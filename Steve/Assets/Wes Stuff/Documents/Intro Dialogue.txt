Overworld Dialogue:
Meanwhile... at Pigworts Institute for the Incredibly Wizardery...
*Bump* * Crash* *Slam* *Hip Stern Kick!*

Dumdoor:
Who the bum frum dee-dum? Doth thou knowst non-less honorable ingress? What incredibly rum-lum-frum-dum!! Dum... dee-dum...

Wizpster:
Whoooooa! Whoa, whoa... You are truly welcome, thow whitest beard man. For I come to be a comfort at your side. My heart yerns to learn to Wiz!

Dumdoor:
It's Dum-door... And I think, my lad, you mean “learn how to be... wizardery!”

Wizpster:
One does not simply learn to wiz, one must be wiz.

Dumdoor:
… that is highly... disagreeable... *uh-hum* Nevertheless! If thine heart desires to become a wizard, one must be perceptive, intelligent, and dexterous! 

Wizpster:
Your great Dum, I present before thee as the righteous paragon! I reek of the the finest ingenuity and perfection. By through natural selection, I was born to Wiz!

Dumdoor:
Please stop saying that... If you wish to learn the ways, you must follow my commands. First, you must assemble the physical components that craft your desired magic effect. Making a wand is a simple enough first task.

Once you have collected your materials, you must enchant them with unworldly aura! Then, to complete your wizardery task, you must gesture all your being into a substantial display! Only then, will you be considered truly wizardly.  

Wizpster:
Bro, I'm on dom, like a rom-tom. 

Dumdoor:
… whatever... Remember, your journey is the same but, your resolution may sway. Let's begin!
